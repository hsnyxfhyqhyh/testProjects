This is a test GUI project created for Katherine, it is not complete finished. 

The game name is "Trouble" , it is some sort of Air plane chess. 

to mimic the game, i created a 9x9 grid, one button for each grid cell. 

4 players will play the game together. 

There are dice button, home button, route button. 

	Client.java - this contains the main function to start the game. 
	GButton.java - this is an extension to the JButton in swing, it has the additional logic built in to help the game. 
	Layout.java - the central piece of the game to initialize everything. 
	Player.java - This has the player information, and to get the next player info 


Next step: 
	To handle the complete logic to finish the game. 
	Right now the home button can start 4 letters. Click the dice button in the middle will give a number, but this number is not used yet. 
	Route for each player is pre-determined, but not tied with the number yet.
